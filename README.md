Well-known text (WKT) offers a compact machine- and human-readable 
representation of geometric objects. WKT may also be used for succinctly 
describing the critical elements of coordinate reference system (CRS) 
definitions. 

WKT was described in the Open Geospatial Consortium implementation 
specifications 99-036 through 06-103r4 and ISO 19125-1:2004. The WKT 
representation of coordinate reference systems was subsequently extended in 
Open Geospatial Consortium implementation specification 01-009 
“Coordinate Transformation Services” and this extension was later adopted in 
the Open Geospatial Consortium GeoAPI 3.0 implementation standard 09-083r3 and 
GeoPackage 1.0 implementation standard 12-128r10. 
The WKT representation of coordinate reference systems as defined in 
ISO 19125-1:2004 and OGC specification 01-009 is inconsistent with the 
terminology and technical provisions of ISO 19111:2007 and OGC Abstract 
Specification topic 2 (08-015r2), “Geographic information — Spatial 
referencing by coordinates”.
